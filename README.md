# City-Explorer

**Author**: Nada Al-Abdullah
**Version**: 1.2.0 

## Overview
I created this lab to building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated reqeusts for data from a thrid-party API.

## Getting Started
1. Draw the web request-response cycle.
2. creat a form that the user will be using to input the location name .

3. create a function that will be taking the location form the user when the user submits the form.

4. send that request over to location IQ.

5. save the location information in a state and then 
display the informaion for the user on the browser.

## Architecture
